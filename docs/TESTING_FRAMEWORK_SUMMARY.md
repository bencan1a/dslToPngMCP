## ✅ Framework Usage

### Quick Start Commands

**⚠️ Important: All tests must be run using Docker Compose to ensure proper environment setup and dependencies.**

```bash
# Run all tests (REQUIRED METHOD)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml up

# Alternative: Run specific test categories within Docker environment
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml run test-runner pytest -m "smoke"  # Smoke tests
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml run test-runner pytest tests/unit/  # Unit tests
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml run test-runner pytest tests/integration/  # Integration tests
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml run test-runner pytest tests/performance/  # Performance tests
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml run test-runner pytest tests/security/  # Security tests
```

**Note**: Direct `pytest` commands should not be used outside the Docker environment as they lack the required service dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.) and proper environment configuration.
```

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatic execution on push/PR
- **Quality Gates**: Automatic pass/fail based on coverage and performance
- **Reporting**: HTML reports with coverage visualization
