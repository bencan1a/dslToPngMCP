# DSL to PNG Test Framework Overview

## Architecture Overview

The DSL to PNG testing framework is designed as a comprehensive, multi-layered testing solution that ensures the reliability, performance, and security of the DSL to PNG conversion system. The framework follows industry best practices and provides extensive coverage across all system components.

## Framework Components

### 1. Test Infrastructure (`tests/`)

```
tests/
├── conftest.py              # Global test configuration and fixtures
├── __init__.py              # Test package initialization
├── unit/                    # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/             # Integration tests for component interactions
├── performance/             # Performance and load testing
├── security/                # Security vulnerability testing
├── deployment/              # Docker and deployment testing
├── data/                    # Test data, scenarios, and examples
└── utils/                   # Testing utilities and helpers
```

### 2. Core Testing Utilities (`tests/utils/`)

- **`assertions.py`**: Custom assertion helpers for DSL validation, PNG validation, performance checks

### 3. Test Data Management (`tests/data/`)

- **`sample_dsl_documents.py`**: Comprehensive collection of DSL test documents
- **`sample_render_options.py`**: Predefined render configurations for various scenarios
- **`test_scenarios.py`**: Structured test scenarios combining documents and options

## Test Execution Strategies

### Local Development

```bash
# Quick feedback cycle
pytest -m "smoke"                    # < 2 minutes
pytest tests/unit/                   # 5-10 minutes
pytest -m "unit and not slow"       # Fast unit tests only

# Comprehensive validation
pytest                               # Full test suite
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html  # With coverage
```

### Continuous Integration

```bash
# GitHub Actions workflow stages
1. Smoke tests (all branches)        # Fast feedback
2. Unit tests (matrix)               # Cross-platform validation
3. Integration tests (main/develop)  # Workflow validation
4. Performance tests (scheduled)     # Regression detection
5. Security tests (all branches)     # Vulnerability detection
```

### Release Validation

```bash
# Pre-release testing
pytest -m "critical"                 # Critical path validation
pytest -m "regression"               # Regression test suite
docker compose -f docker/docker compose.test.yml up  # Containerized testing
```
